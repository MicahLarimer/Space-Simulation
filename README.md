A Python-based 3D simulation of the solar system, modeling planetary and asteroid orbits with gravitational physics and collision detection, visualized using Matplotlib.

## Features
- Simulates 7 planets and 2 asteroids over 1 year with daily time steps.
- Calculates gravitational forces and elastic collisions.
- Visualizes 3D orbits with animated trails and labels.
- Handles realistic astronomical units and masses.
